Only log in with remote desktop. This is due to multiple sessions. One remote and one local.
You may encounter a blank screen or the system will not log in at all closing the session immediately

To solve this “second session” problem and allow as many sessions as you need,

edit /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh and add these lines BEFORE the lines that test and execute Xsession.

(The $HOME/.profile is not part of the solution (IS NOT NECESSARY), but is something that should be run before starting the session anyway.)

    unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
    unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
    . $HOME/.profile


This does not work in openSuse but works in:

Debian, Linux Mint, KDE Neon, Ubuntu 18.04 (and distros based on Ubuntu)


REMEMEBER!
When you set your credentials to log in remember that Debian is case sensitive for the user
It could happen that you try to entery with a initial capital letter and the xrdp manager will not allow you to enter
Even if you have set up your user with a capital letter 'Myuser' remember that for xrdp you need
to indicate it as 'myuser' therefore with lower case !
