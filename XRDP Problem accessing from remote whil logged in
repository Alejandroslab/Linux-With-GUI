Only log in with remote desktop. This is due to multiple sessions. One remote and one local.
You may encounter a blank screen or the system will not log in at all closing the session immediately

To solve this “second session” problem and allow as many sessions as you need,

edit /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh and add these lines BEFORE the lines that test and execute Xsession.

(The $HOME/.profile is not part of the solution (IS NOT NECESSARY), but is something that should be run before starting the session anyway.)

    unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
    unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
    . $HOME/.profile


This does not work in openSuse but works in Linux Mint, KDE Neon
