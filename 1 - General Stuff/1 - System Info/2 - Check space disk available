and 

df -h --total

Rememember that this command will show only mounted partitions that are partitions like your current partition in which the os lives and
any other device (maybe external) that has been mounted

If you have run dual boot this will not show you other partition (like Windows partition)


use 
lsblk

to list all the partitions of your disk (mounted and unmounted) 
You can see that your os lives where root is indicate (the symbol '/')
