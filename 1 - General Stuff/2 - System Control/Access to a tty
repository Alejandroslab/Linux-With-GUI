access to a tty (terminal subsystem) in any momento just pressing:

ctrl + alt + f2

to go back to your DE just press

ctrl+alt+f1 or try another f like f3,f4,f5

Usually is also f7

you can have anyways for any function key a new tty (you will see tty2, tty3 etc)


This is useful when the system crashes
It will give you access to a terminal that will not be anymore virtual (like the ones you meet inside your GUI system)
