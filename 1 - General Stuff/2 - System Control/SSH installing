Firs install
REMEMBER! In Debian you have to install 'openssh-server' as it is not installed by default

These commands are also valid for Linux Mint

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install openssh-server


In Debian it is usually only necesary only this last command and everything will work out!
------


then edit with nano or other text editor the config file

sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config

Insert these lines at the end:
____________________
Port 22
MaxAuthTries

SendEnv LANG LC_*
HashKnownHost yes
GSSAPAuthentication yes
_________________________

(without the line at the beginning and at the end)

If the lines are already there but start with # you should just delete the # symbol.

Save and close nano (or other)

________

To check the status

sudo service ssh status

If the service is not running:

 sudo service ssh start

and you can stop with:

 sudo service ssh stop

Then you are done.

REMEMBER! To autostart on boot the service use this syntax.

sudo systemctl enable ssh

Use this instead of 'sudo service ssh start'.
Because this seems to work only once,

REMEMBER! In Debian root is the only user at first. If you want to login as root
you should add the line 'PermitRootLogin yes' to the ssh config file.

_________________________________________
In windows there are 2 ways to connect via ssh.

with PowerShell or with Putty a free and open source program.
PowerShell is pretty good but Putty has far more configuration options.
Anyways if you need just to connect quickly you can use PowerShell
Look at my PowerSheel repo on how to add SSH capabilities in Windows (it is an hidden option that you have to enable)



The other way is to download Putty and connect to the server with hostname or IP address
hostname, hostname -I

(To copy lines in putty just highlight them. To paste lines in Putty just click right in the terminal windows).

At the first starting of Putty, a security alert will appear indicating then
'key fingerprint' in md5 format. Keep note of this fingerprint.

Click 'No' the first time then login in the server (Putty will ask to save in the cache)

type:

ssh-keygen -E md5 -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub

now compare the two fingerprint. if they are the same you can safely save the Connection
to the Putty's cache)
__________________________________-



In Mac and Linux (whichever distro) just open Terminal, check if openssh is installed typing

ssh

then just:

ssh username@IPserverOrHostname

REMEMBER thta the IPserverOrHostname is NOT case sensitive

it will then ask for your password and then you will connect to the server.

_________________________

For the fingerprint check, in mac it will be printed the ECDSA key in SHA256

therfore just type in your remote machine:

ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub

ECDSA it's a public key available in the folder /etc/ssh (but this will not be the same as
the one obtained with the command)

REMEMBER! that you can always check any public key (those with extension .pub)
that are available in the folder going to:

cd /etc/ssh

ls -l

you will then use the command (for SHA256)

ssh-keygen -l -f

or the command

ssh-keygen -E md5 -l -f

for md5


next you can quickly check differences with 'diff' command

first copy and paste the output from the remote machine

nano remotemachine_finger.txt

then do the same for the fingerprint displayed in Mac:

nano mac_finger.txt


then:

diff remotemachine_finger.txt mac_finger.txt


if it outputs nothing, then you are done! no differences between fingerprints.

You can safely add to cache the connection.

______________________________________________

if you have a specific port to connect (look at the case of LXC containers)
the syntax will be:

ssh username@IPserverOrHostname -p numberofport

where numberofport is the number where ssh should look
it could be like:

ssh username@IPserverOrHostname -p 1099

REMEMBER! it is not necessary to add the suffix like
'.local' to the name of your server
and remmember that is not case sensitive


____________________
configuration files:

ssh_config is the config file for the ssh client
if you want to ssh to another remote host machine, you use a SSH client.


sshd_config is the config file for the daemon

If someone wants to connect to your host machine via SSH,
their SSH client settings (port number, version etc)
must match your sshd_config
settings in order to communicate with you,
