you know that for updates you have to run every time:

sudo apt-get update

there are shortcust that in linux are called 'alias' that allow to save time

we can create one with this syntax:

alias update='sudo apt-get update'

after run the term 'update' the system will load the correspondent:

sudo apt-get update


to store permanently aliases just open .bashrc (that is hidden) in home folder
and add them

(plus when opening .bashrc you will see some commented example of aliases)


alias will work even in Mac
