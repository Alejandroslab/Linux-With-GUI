Sometimes not all connected USB devices are listed with:

lsusb

this may be a problem related with firmware and not of drivers.
This because lsusb loads all firware info of any device

If your device (say like a wifi adapter) is not listed we can try to check kernel logs with:

sudo dmesg

This will list all the events and the errors related 

If there is some firmware related issue like a .lib file missing then you will need to download it from anywhere on the internet and finally place under

/lib/firmware/folder_of_firmware_missing

where the firmware missing is the folder that if does not exist you will need to create

under this folder you will have to place your .lib file!

Then unplug and plug again your usb device (and maybe reboot) and done

after that with

lsusb

you will find your device listed !
