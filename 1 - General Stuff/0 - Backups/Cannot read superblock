2 things to do: partition alignment and superblock recovering

sudo parted /dev/sdb

type p to print the partition table

if you see some partition are not aligned, that is that the numbers are not listed sequentially like 1,2,3....

then run:

align-check opt partition-number

where "partition-number" is the number of the partitoin that you need to align

then type q to quit

if still doe not solve the problem then we have to recover the superblock, that is the very first block of the partition:
(in this case these instructions are just for ext partitions)

sudo parted -l

sudo mke2fs -n /dev/sdb5

change sdb5 according to your damaged partition

It will tell you that the partition contains an ext4 file system, press y to continue. Donâ€™t worry the -n option tells mke2fs not to create a file system.

At the bottom, you can see the location of backup superblocks. Next, restore the superblock from the first backup copy.


sudo e2fsck -b 32768 /dev/sdb6

now with e2fsck you will scan all the ext partition. Once recovered the superblock it may be necessary to check the file system 
e2fsck command will ask you if you want to correct some errors

Type yes and done. after a while everything will finish!
