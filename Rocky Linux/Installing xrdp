sudo dnf install epel-release
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install xrdp
sudo systemctl start xrdp
sudo systemctl enable xrdp
systemctl status xrdp

Now allow the firewall:

#Add Firewall
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=3389/tcp
#Reload Firewall service
firewall-cmd --reload

Finally log out your current Rocky Linux session, so that we can access it on Windows using its Remote desktop application.

This xrdp will work with xvnc
For multiple session with the same user you can try to install xorg (i have not tested it)
