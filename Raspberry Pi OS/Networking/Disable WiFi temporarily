sudo ifconfig wlan0 down

To completely disable the onboard WiFi from the firmware on the Pi3 / Pi4, add

dtoverlay=disable-wifi

in /boot/config.txt.

Please be sure to use an up to date firmware, this feature was added in January 2017.

sudo nano /boot/config.txt

There is also an overlay for disabling onboard bluetooth : disable-bt. If you want to disable both wifi and bluetooth, you need to add these 2 lines :

dtoverlay=disable-wifi
dtoverlay=disable-bt

NOTE : If you are using an old 'Pi3 only' firmware, you need to prefix the overlay name with pi3-.
