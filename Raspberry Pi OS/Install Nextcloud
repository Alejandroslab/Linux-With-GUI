First install packages:

sudo apt install apache2 mariadb-server libapache2-mod-php

sudo apt install php-gd php-json php-mysql php-curl php-mbstring php-intl php-imagick php-xml php-zip

sudo apt install php7.3-gd php7.3-json php7.3-mysql php7.3-curl php7.3-mbstring php7.3-intl php-imagick php7.3-xml php7.3-zip

you will need to install the correct versions. If they are not correct nextcloud will not run


We move to the apache folder

cd /var/www/html

and we download Nextcloud

sudo wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-21.0.0.zip

remember to check in the website the current version! (you will have to change the number at the end)
you will also need to check that the packages in the prerequisites are comptabile with the Nextcloud version
that you are installing


we can now extract with 'unzip'

sudo unzip nextcloud-21.0.0.zip


we change now permission in order to make Nextcloud available to Apache:

sudo chmod 750 nextcloud -R
sudo chown www-data:www-data nextcloud -R



Now we can create the MySQL Database to store the data:

sudo mysql

with this last command we will enter in Mysql environment with all its syntax
Now we create a user

CREATE USER 'nextcloud' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

you must put a strong password instead of the word password (but leave the single quotes)

Proceed to create a DATABASE
CREATE DATABASE nextcloud;

now give the permission to the user created:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nextcloud.* TO 'nextcloud'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'MYPASSWORD';


REMEMBER!
in this command:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nextcloud.* TO 'nextcloud'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'MYPASSWORD';

the quotes always must be single quotes like '' and not smart quotes like ‘ ’

you can see the difference because the smart quotes are a little bit inclined towards right.


now:


FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

and

quit

the command 'quit' will allow you to exit from mariadb






Now you can access Nextcloud in a browser:

https://IP/nextcloud

or

http://IP/nextcloud

or

https://hostname/nextcloud

or

http://hostname/nextcloud
