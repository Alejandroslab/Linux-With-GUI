sudo apt install mariadb-server

to access:

sudo mysql

to setup the root account:

sudo mysql_secure_installation

Then you’ll need to create a new user and a database
And finally you can configure the server in the /etc/mysql folder


Once you are connected, you can use all the MySQL queries like these:

    SHOW DATABASES;
    USE <database>;
    SHOW TABLES;
    SELECT * FROM <table>;
    UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, …
