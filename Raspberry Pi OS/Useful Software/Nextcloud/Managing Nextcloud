to access Nextcloud folders you have to remember that the default path of installation will be

 /var/www/nextcloud

 or

 /var/www/html/nextcloud


it is possible to move the folder afterwards (e.g. to an external drive connected to the raspberry)
but it is quite tricky. therefore is suggested to specify the correct destination during installation
