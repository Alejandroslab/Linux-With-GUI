Opposed to most other Linux distributions, Raspberry Pi is based on ARM architecture. Hence, not all Docker images will work on your Raspberry Pi.

In fact, all Docker images that are not specifically designed for ARM devices will not work. Running docker-apps designed for x86/x64 and i386 architecture on your Raspberry Pi will return an error.

This is the case of (Microsoft) SQL Server. This will not work as it has not be adapted for ARM architectures
