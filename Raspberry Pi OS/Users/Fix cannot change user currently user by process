you can change your username but sometimes it could happen that
the process is used by the old user (by systemd or sshd if you have set up an ssh connection)

to solve this within ssh connection:

go to

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

and add:

PermitRootLogin yes

then restart the ssh server
systemctl restart sshd

now exit from the current ssh session
and connect it directly to root with

ssh root@hostname_or_ip

type your password (or just put 'PermitRootLogin without-password' if you have not set up a password for root)

then change your user as usual

DONE!
