first if you have not done it already set a password for root

sudo passwd root

then go to preferences 'Raspberry Pi Configuration' and near to 'Auto login'
check 'Disabled'

reboot your system

now type in user: root
and in the password your password

it will open the root desktop!


(If it does not load properly you can anyways open a terminal with the
shortcut ctrl + alt + t)

from there open terminal and type:

usermod -l <new_user> pi

now rename the home directory:

usermod -m -d /home/<new_user> <new_user>

e.g.

usermod -m -d /home/mike mike


after change your user you can check 'Autologin with 'pi' user' in 'Raspberry Pi Configuration'
in Preferences

Even if it is reported 'pi' user the system will boot in your pi renamed user!

that's it!
