run this and follow the instruction
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash


then the PiHole DNS server will be installed
In order to make it usable you have to link your router to your Pihole and set it as a DNS Server

otherwise you can use PiHole just on some devices going in the network Settings
and changing the IP of the DNS server


You can also set the DNS server in your own VPN Settings (use pivpn or algo vpn)

you can access to dashboard with:

http://IP_or_Hostname/admin
