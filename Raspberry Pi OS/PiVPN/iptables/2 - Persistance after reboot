Finally if you want the rules to autostart when rebooting
you may need iptables-persistent

sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent



anyways this should usually autoinstalled along with pivpn

therefore you may not need. Anyways launch it to be sure that you have it
(if it is already installed you will be notified and it will not be reinstalled)
_______________

IF IT IS ALREADY INSTALLED (as it should be) YOU MUST RUN:

sudo netfilter-persistent save

otherwise your rules will not be saved
