instead of DROP you can use also REJECT

but:

REJECT command sends a response message.
And, this message will ensure the attackers about the existence of the server on the other end.

It will give away information like open ports, software versions, etc which is risky.
Incase of a DDOS attack, the server needs to respond to each request with a response.

But, dropping the packet doesnâ€™t give the user any clue regarding the connection failure.

And, this is the main reason why the DROP command is more preferred.
