TO Delete a rule:

first list the rules with line numbers:

sudo iptables -L --line-numbers

if you have multiple chains defined like INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD etc just indicate the chain:
in this case i want to delete a rule in the forward chain:

sudo iptables -L FORWARD --line-numbers

after you take the number line just run:

sudo iptables -D FORWARD 9

where '9' is the line number of your rule
