You can safely install PiVPN on the same Raspberry Pi as your Pi-hole install,
and point your VPN clients to the IP of your Pi-hole so they get ad blocking, etc.
(replace 192.168.23.211 with the LAN IP of your Raspberry Pi).

Note that if you install PiVPN after Pi-hole,
your existing Pi-hole installation will be detected and
the script will ask if you want to use it as the DNS for the VPN, so you won't need to go through all these steps.

    Edit the server config with sudo nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf
    Remove every push "dhcp-option DNS [...]" line
    Add this line push "dhcp-option DNS 192.168.23.211" to point clients to the PiVPN IP
    Save the file and exit
    Restart openvpn with
    sudo systemctl restart openvpn
    Run
    pihole -a -i local
    to tell Pi-hole to listen on all interfaces
