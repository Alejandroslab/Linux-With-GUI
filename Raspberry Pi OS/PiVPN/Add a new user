pivpn add

follow the instructions, provide a password and DONE
Remember! you can also copy and paste in the terminal from a password generator
You will not see the password but it will paste it anyhow

the certificate with extension .ovpn
will be created inside the folder 'ovpns'




(In sftp but also sometimes in Windows File Explorer you may not be able to download it
or to copy the certificate
To fix this move to the folder 'ovpns' then change permissions with:

sudo chmod 777 mycertificate.ovpn

then you can transfer it)

______________________________

It seems that you cannot change password. You must drop the user :(

____________________________
To download your new certificate within command line:

access with 'sftp':

remember! Now if you use 'pwd' (or 'ls') you will get the remote path (or list of files/folder)
 (the path/files and folders of the server and not the local ones)

if you want to use pwd in local machine (client) you will need to put the letter 'l' (of 'local')
before any commands
therefore:

pwd will become 'lpwd', ls will become 'lls'


to download, first cd to the right folder then:

get mycertificate.ovpn
