follow the instructions, provide a password and DONE
Remember while in mac you can also copy and paste in the terminal from a password generator 


the certificate with extension .ovpn
will be created inside the folder 'ovpns'




(In sftp but also sometimes in Windows File Explorer you may not be able to download it
or to copy the certificate
To fix this move to the folder 'ovpns' then change permissions with:

sudo chmod 777 mycertificate.ovpn

then you can transfer it)
