check your current iptables (this command is for IPV4)

sudo iptables -L -nv


Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 89492 packets, 17M bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 82746 packets, 36M bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 74790 packets, 36M bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination


this is the default settings
you see here 3 parts called 'chains': INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT
they have all policy as 'ACCEPT'
this means that if a packet reaches the end of a chain it will be accepted.
'Reaches the end of the chain' means that the software will check all the rules
from the beginning to the end, following a linear order.

REMEMBER! the OUTPUT chain applies to locally generated packets
For packets that are routed via the system you have to use
FORWARD chain!


these are the options:

-A or append allows to add a rule at the end of the chain

-D or delete allows to remove the rule identified by a number
    -D CHAINNAME number_of_rule

  where number_of_rule is the number of the line
  therefore the rule number one will be the first at top (that corresponds to the first line)

-L will list the rules of the chain
    -L CHAINNAME

-F allows to empty a chain
    -F CHAINNAME


the option to describe the packet:
-j is the behaviour als called 'policy' could be (DROP or ACCEPT)
-p is the protocol
-s is the source IP
-d is the destination IP
-i is the type of interface (eth0 wlan0 or tun0)
-g the chain to go forward
-t the table (the default one it the table filter)

e.g.

This commands allows to block any LOCAL packets outgoing to a particular ip

sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d 192.168.1.25 -j DROP

if you need to block ALL packets that are passing in the machine in which
are you setting the iptables commands, directed to a particular IP
you have to use the FORWARD chain.
Therefore the command will be the same but you will need to use the FORWARD chain

sudo iptables -A FORWARD -d 192.168.1.25 -j DROP

you must be root to add these rules!

in Windows you can scan your network to see your devices with
angry ip

Finally if you want the rules to autostart when rebooting
you may need iptables-persistent

sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent

anyways this should usually autoinstalled along with pivpn
therefore you may not need. Anyways launch it to be sure that you have it
(if it is already installed you will be notified and it will not be reinstalled)
