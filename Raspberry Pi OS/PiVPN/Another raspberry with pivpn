TIP IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER PIVPN:
You need to portforwording indicating a public port that is different than 1194 as the router
will not allow to use a port that is already taken. (while the local port must be 1194 as this is the one in which
pivpn installed is listening)

The public port is also the 'remote' port that is indicated in the certificate itself and also in the 'Default.txt' files
sudo nano /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/Default.txt

so just change the 'remote' port in the certificate (if you have already issued one), in the 'Default.txt' file accordingly
to which port you have indicated in your router as 'public ' port.
Remember that the local port must remain 1194. You have also just to change the 'public' hence the 'remote' port in the pivpn files.
