edit

sudo nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf

replace every
push "dhcp-option DNS [...]" with a SINGLE

push "dchp-option DNS 192.168.1.309" (where 192.168.1.309 is your gateway)

then restart openvpn

sudo systemctl restart openvpn

THIS SEEMS TO NOT WORK IN WINDOWS as windows does not resolve local hostnames anyways

or you can change your

/etc/hosts file and add manually line by line something like this:

192.168.1.250 Mypc
192.168.1.290 Mybrotherpc
...

IPaddress hostname
