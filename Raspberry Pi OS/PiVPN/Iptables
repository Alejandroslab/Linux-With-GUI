check your current iptables (this command is for IPV4)

sudo iptables -L -nv


Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 89492 packets, 17M bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 82746 packets, 36M bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 74790 packets, 36M bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination


this is the default settings
you see here 3 parts called 'chains': INPUT, FORWARD AN OUTPUT
they have all policy as 'ACCEPT'
this means that if a packet reaches the end of a chain it will be accepted.
'Reaches the end of the chain' means that the software will check all the rules
from the beginning to the end, following a linear order.

these are the options:

-A or append allows to add a rule at the end of the chain

-D or delete allows to remove the rule identified by a number
    -D CHAINNAME number_of_rule

-L will list the rules of the chain
    -L CHAINNAME

-F allows to empty a chain
    -F CHAINNAME


the option to describe the packet:
-j is the behaviour als called 'policy' could be (DROP or ACCEPT)
-p is the protocol
-s is the source IP
-d is the destination IP
-i is the type of interface (eth0 wlan0 or tun0)
-g the chain to go forward
-t the table (the default one it the table filter)

e.g.

This commands allows to block any packets outgoing to a particular ip

sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d 192.168.1.25 -j DROP

you must be root to add these rules!
