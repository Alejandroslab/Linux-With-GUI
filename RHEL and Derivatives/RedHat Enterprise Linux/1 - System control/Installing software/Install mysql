2 ways to do this:
FIRST WAY:

sudo yum install mysql

SECOND WAY (this has not worked for me):

First add the YUM repository
this is for RHEL 8:
wget https://repo.mysql.com/mysql80-community-release-el8-4.noarch.rpm

then:

sudo yum localinstall mysql80-community-release-el8-4.noarch.rpm

to check the yum repo:

yum repolist enabled | grep "mysql.*-community.*"

INSTALL mysql

sudo yum install mysql-community-server
