whenever you want to change the password either of root or other user you have to switch to the user that will not be affected by the change

Let's suppose that we have 2 users: root and test. Where test has root privileges

If I want to change root password I need to do that from the user 'test' with:

sudo passwd root

enter the 'test' password and finally change the passoword of root


If I want to change the 'test' password then I must switch over to root

su root

then enter root password and finally change the 'test' user password 


always log out then!
