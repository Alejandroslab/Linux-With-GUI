I have installed this on RHEL 8.5

On RHEL you cannot install it without docker. Therefore you need to install docker and docker-compose before:

sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf install yum-utils curl git -y

sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

update the package:

sudo dnf makecache

Install Docker with this command:

sudo dnf install docker-ce --nobest

sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

Now install docker-compose:

sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.4/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Done!
Check the version: 

docker-compose --version


Now install Jitsi Meet

git clone https://github.com/jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet

copy the sample environment:
cd docker-jitsi-meet
cp env.example .env

create required directories for Jitsi meet:
mkdir -p ~/.jitsi-meet-cfg/{web/letsencrypt,transcripts,prosody,jicofo,jvb}

Now build the Jitsi Meet Docker image

docker-compose up -d

Now if this command will not work you have to add your user to docker group:

add first the group 'docker':
 sudo groupadd docker
 
 sudo usermod -aG docker $USER


Now if the error is 'cannot allocate memory inside container docker'
It means that your server needs more RAM or CPU (but mainly more RAM). If you have a VPS you need to upgrade your VPS
 
 

 
 With this we can check all the running containers
 
 docker ps
 
 At this point, Jitsi meet container is started and running on port 8443.
 
 Finally check your firewall and enable the following ports:
 
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=443/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=4443/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=10000/udp --permanent

sudo firewall-cmd --reload

If you are on a local network and you want to get access from the external world then you need to port forwarding these ports on your router 
(if you have a cascading routers set up you need a double port forwarding one for the main router that connects to the second one that finally connects to your server 
in which jitsi meet is installed)

Now, open your web browser and access the Jitsi Meet using the URL https://your-server-ip:8443/
