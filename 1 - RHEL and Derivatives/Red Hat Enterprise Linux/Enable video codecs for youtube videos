to enable video codecs you just have to install ffmpeg package

to do that

sudo subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms

sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/el/rpmfusion-free-release-8.noarch.rpm

sudo dnf upgrade
sudo dnf install ffmpeg

if dnf upgrade retries errors no worries just proceed to install ffmpeg 

done!
