sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

for jdk 8 

or

sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel

for jdk 11


remember! to work correctyl you must install just one java version if you have installed jdk 8 and then jdk11 you must remove one of them (angry ip will not work with jdk8)

to remove jdk 8 for instance that:

sudo yum remove java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
