RHEL is not intended for desktop users 

however someone may want to use some common software

at the moment (january 2023) RHEL supports snap store and this is the only way to install other software (like spotify but also some other stuff)

anyways remember that a lot of package like guake, hollywood will not work 




first add the epel repo (in rhel 8):

sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
sudo dnf upgrade

then add the optional and extra repos 


sudo subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"
sudo yum update



finally install snap:

sudo yum install snapd


enable it as a service:

sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket



To enable classic snap support, enter the following to create a symbolic link between /var/lib/snapd/snap and /snap:

sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap

Either log out and back in again or restart your system to ensure snapâ€™s paths are updated correctly.


sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap




done!
