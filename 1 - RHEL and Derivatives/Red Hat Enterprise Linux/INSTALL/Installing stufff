you can use dnf or yum alternatively

IT IS BETTER FOR LATEST VERSIONS OF RHEL TO USE 'DNF' INSTEAD OF 'YUM'

sudo dnf install myapp

sudo yum install myapp

dnf or yum or just helper

they will check if you have already installed your app with either dnf or yum

they will not reinstall it if it is already installed


add -y to skip the confirmation 


sudo yum install myapp -y
