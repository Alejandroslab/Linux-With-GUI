RHEL
You can download a copy completely free from redhat website after you enroll in the developer program
Basically you have to register using an email and setting a password

Then you will be able to download the ISO of RHEL

After the installation you will not be able to download any package from terminal until you not register
the system.
To do that simply connect using your username and password
REMEMBER the username is not the email is an user that you set during registration and you will not be able to change
