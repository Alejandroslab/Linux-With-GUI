as in red hat you do not have access to common repositories 

(this procedure will work for both Red Hat and Fedora)

you can access to 'higan' the snes emulator with flatpak 

anyways after the installation you have to search for 'bsnes' and not 'higan'

to install first install flatpak 

sudo dnf install flatpak


finally run this without sudo

flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

flatpak install flathub dev.bsnes.bsnes

done!
now look for bsnes and you can load your ROM's.

remember to set the commands mapping of the keyboard in preferences as these are not set up by default,

have fun!
