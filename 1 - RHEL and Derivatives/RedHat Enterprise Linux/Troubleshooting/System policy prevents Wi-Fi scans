When in XRDP this message appears constantly "System policy prevents Wi-Fi scans"
particularly when you open the Settings app

You will not be able to get rid of it even entering the password correctly multiple times

The only solution is to reboot via ssh (rememberr to always set the connection via ssh as well as xrdp )
as if you kill the xrdp service (sudo systemctl restart xrdp) you will not be able to relogin again..


To overcome this connect to your server via ssh and then:

change to root:
 sudo su

move to this folder:

cd /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d

and edit this file (or create it if there is none)

vi 51-allow-wifi-scan.pkla


add this content to that file (the file may be empty):

[Network Manager all Users]
Identity=unix-user:*
Action=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.settings.modify.system;org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.wifi.scan
ResultAny=no
ResultInactive=no
ResultActive=yes


save and exit
now reboot ! or relogin and the message will not appear anymore
