add a new user

sudo adduser newuser2

remember you can also use an user with a dot inside like: 'mark.spencer' but you cannot use '@' symbol 
(in some systems you cannot use even the dot)

by default the newuser is not in the sudoers group that means does not have any priviliges 
it is just a normal user 


In Fedora the password for the user will not be asked immediately you must set it with:

sudo passwd newuser2
