sudo yum install cockpit

enable then with:

sudo systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket

finally if you have firewalld enabled. check it with:

sudo systemctl status firewalld 

then you have to add an exception 

sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=cockpit
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

if you do not have a firewall enabled and you are on a VPS then you have to check if your provider does not provide another firewall by default

Usually the provider will have deployed a firewall that you can see it in the VPS control panel

from there you have to open port 9090 (the default one for cockpit) or another one you choose to run it (but then you have to change your config files)

and then done! you can access your cockpit 

just remember that it will take some time to load (and you may need to click on 'Advanced' after a security warning in your browser=
Then it is probably better that you close the port after you have finished your work
