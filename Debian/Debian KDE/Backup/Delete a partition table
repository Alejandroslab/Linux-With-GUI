If you have already performed a disk to disk Backup
and just want to format your drive follow these steps.

you know that Clonezilla has created a partition table
with all your partitions, creating a very exact copy
of your hd on your external hd

now if you want to erase it (because for example you have
an HD bigger than 2tb and want to gain back all your capacity)
the easiest solution is using DISKPART in windows

just open cmd as Administrator

then:

list disk

select your external disk (be very carefull here, in the list the
first disk is numbered as '0', the second one as '1' and so on)

select disk 1


then just type:

clean

this will delete all partitions

now convert to a GUID partiton table disk (the only format that allows the usage of more than 2tb of capacity)
(remmeber thta MBR that is copied with clonezilla during the 'disk to disk' backup process,
only allows the usage of 2tb, the excessive space will remain unallocated but also unusable)

type:

conver gpt

done!

now if you go to disk management you will see just one block of unallocated space
click on create new volume and you are done!
