you can download themes for the login screen

just open the menu and look for

'Login Screen'

then if the error regarding the Clock appears:

Type Clock unavailable & qt-quickcontrols 2.5 not installed


here is the solution:

You have to change the version for QtQuick.Controls in the Clock.qml file to 1.1 (same as the one in Main.qml)
I did the following and that made it work.

sudo nano /usr/share/sddm/themes/McMojave/components/Clock.qml

change the line import QtQuick.Controls 2.5 to import QtQuick.Controls 1.1

Save and exit. Logout and login again, see if the theme is working now.
