REMEMBER! if you installed PiVPN on or after 17/02/2020 static IPs are set by default

anyways you can check here:

cd /etc/openvpn/ccd

if you see inside with 'ls' the list of the user
then you will know that every user has its own static ip

you can check further looking inside

sudo nano myvpnuser

you will find something like
ifconfig-push IP subnet

e.g.
ifconfig-push 10.8.0.3 255.255.255.0
