Just:
sudo nano /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini

[xrdp1]
name=sesman-vnc
lib=libvnc.so
username=ask
password=ask
ip=127.0.0.1
port=-1


change the port from -1 to another positive number
Xrdp in this way will connect everytime to the same session

or you can also set 'port=ask' so everytime will ask about the session
If you want a new session you will have to type '-1'
