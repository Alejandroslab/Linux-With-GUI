First you need to install tex live


sudo apt-get install texlive-full

then install:

sudo apt-get install texmaker

then install latexmk needed to automate the process of generating a latex document:

sudo apt-get install texmaker

now in Atom just download the
'latex' package from tomasjo to compile within atom latex documents
'pdf-view' from izuzak to enable to view pdf files in atom
'language-latex' from area to get latex syntax highlighting in atom

Done!

Now make this changes:

go to Atom-> preferences -> packages
go to settings of the 'latex' package and:

check 'Build on save'
uncheck 'Open result after successful build'
uncheck 'Open result in background'
under 'Output directory' type 'build'

in 'language-latex' package
check 'soft wrap'

If you have download BasicTeX, chances are you have to download packages that publishers use in their templates.
The easiest way is to Google search for the missing packages, or search Comprehensive TEX Archive Network (CTAN).

For example, algorithmic is one of the commonly used packages, and we might see this in the document.

\usepackage{algorithmic}

To install packages, open the Terminal, type:

sudo tlmgr install algorithms

DONE!
