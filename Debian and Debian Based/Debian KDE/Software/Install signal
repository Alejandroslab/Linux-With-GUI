Follow the instruction:

sudo apt install curl


curl -s https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt/keys.asc | sudo apt-key add -


echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt xenial main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/signal-xenial.list


sudo apt update && sudo apt install signal-desktop

After running the commands above, Signal should be installed and ready to use….
although the package repository looks like it’s for Xenial, it should also work!

DONE!


or you can use this (but apparently it does not work anymore)

# 1. Install our official public software signing key
wget -O- https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt/keys.asc | gpg --dearmor > signal-desktop-keyring.gpg
sudo mv signal-desktop-keyring.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/

# 2. Add our repository to your list of repositories
echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/signal-desktop-keyring.gpg] https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt xenial main' |\
  sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/signal-xenial.list

#these last 2 line go in one command
if this errors appears:
W: GPG error: The following signatures couldn’t be verified because the public key is not available: NO error.

you will get a key number. copy that and add it to this command

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 68980A0EA10B4DE8

then you will see that the key has been added

# 3. Update your package database and install signal
sudo apt update && sudo apt install signal-desktop
