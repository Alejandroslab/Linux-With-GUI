If this error appears everytime you boot 

then just go to kdewallet setting (you can find them under settings)
click on 'Change password' and leave it empty 

save it 
click yes on the warning

done!
Now the password prompt on boot and 'kded5' component will not annoy you anymore and everything will login automatically
(I mean the wifi password and so on)

REMEMBER! do not disable Kde wallet subsystem as suggested on the internet as your system may become unstable!
