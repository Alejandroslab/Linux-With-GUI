in Dolphin
open 'Network'

then click on 'Add Network Folder'
then select Microsoft Windows network drive

click on Next

in 'Name' just type a label for your network folder
in 'Server' type the IP or hostname of your server in this way:

myserver.local

in 'Folder' type the location desired

for example

\home

if you know that the path

myserver.local\home

exists


DONE!

you may not need to indicate the 'slash \'
you can in fact indicate the server with:

myserver.local

and the folder just indicating its name:

myfolder


REMEMBER! If you use slahses just use the correct slash AS YOU WERE in Windows.
This is:
'\'
and not the '/'!

if everything has worked correctly then it should ask to authenticate
