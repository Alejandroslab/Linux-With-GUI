in Windows but also in Mac you can scan your network to see your devices with
angry ip

this tool allows to scan all the network interfaces and find hostnames, ips, and open ports

you can test the safety of your current network with this tool

plus, you can check your iptables rules

you can limit some ip's or any connection to connect to some particular ip's or devices

if the rule works, angry ip will check the ip as 'dead' (red ball) as there is no device
for that ip!!
so nice!


remember: red ball: dead or not active
      blue ball: device exists but no port is opened
      green ball: device exists and some port (that you will see in a list inside the program) are opened
