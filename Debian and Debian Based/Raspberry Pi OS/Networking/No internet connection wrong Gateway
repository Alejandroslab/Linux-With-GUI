I have encountered this problem. I had access to the LAN but no access to internet

at first I thought it was a DNS problem but then I checked better and it was a gateway problem 


first check your DNS 

cat /etc/resolv.conf



after that check yur Gateway:

route -n


You will get something like this:

Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0


If you have already used (like for Pihole) your raspberry then there should be indicated an old gateway (a wrong ip) and therefore no internet connection 
will work

(remember that 0.0.0.0 means any destination or device. You can check here how the interfaces communicate
For example, the second line stands for 'any destination in the ip range 192.168.1.0/24 has as gateway the one with ip address 0.0.0.0 that is the 
default one'
The default gateway is always specified in the first row 
where can be translated as 'the default destination can be accessed via gateway 192.168.1.1'



you can manually change the default gateway with the command:

sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1

anyways this will only be temporary (it will last until the next reboot)

therefore:

To change it temporarily just edit the file:

sudo vim /etc/network/interface

after this lines:
# Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:
source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d

paste this:
_______________

auto lo
auto eth0

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
iface default inet dhcp

___________

done ! now when you reboot everything will go in place and you will have internet
