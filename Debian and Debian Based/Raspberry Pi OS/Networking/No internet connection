first check your DNS 

cat /etc/resolv.conf

after that check yur Gateway:

route -n

If you have already used (like for Pihole) your raspberry then there should be indicated an old gateway adn therefore no internet connection 
will work

(remember that 0.0.0.0 means any destination or device)

you can manually change the default gateway with the command:

sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1
