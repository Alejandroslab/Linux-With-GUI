First make a backup of your network configuration

sudo cp /etc/network/interface /etc/network/interface.backup

then change it

sudo vim /etc/network/interface

delete all the content except the line 'source-directory...'

then:

sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd

sudo systemctl disable networking

sudo reboot
