3 IMPORTANT FILES:

sudo vim /etc/xrdp/sesman.ini

sudo vim /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini

sudo vim .xinitrc


the first one will set the session type that will also appear in the small window when connecting (login window)
in the sesman.ini file you will be able just to set some parameters

Session type can be: Xorg, XVnc or something similar and you can even add more, following this syntax:

[MyVNC]
param=x11vnc
param=-noxdamage
...


the name inside the squared brackets is the label that will appear in the login window in the 
dropdown menu


xrdp.ini is the file that sets the session that will be used 
you can here sete the port 


in both sesman.ini and xrdp.ini you can comment some parts with #

finally in some OSes like Manjaro you may want to use the xinitrc file, an hidden file that will launche a new session. Just comment the last line 'get_session...' and add the last line as here:


#exec $(get_session "$1")
exec dbus-launch --sh-syntax startplasma-x11
