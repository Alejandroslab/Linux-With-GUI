How to Fix “Authentication is required to create a color profile/managed device”

Ubuntu (also Kali) uses a software component called Polkit, which is an application authorization framework that captures actions performed by a user to check if the user is authorized to perform certain actions.

When you connect to Ubuntu remotely using RDP / Windows Remote Desktop, you will see the above errors because the Polkit Policy file cannot be accessed without superuser authentication.



The safest fix to get rid of these popups is to create a new configuration file in 

/etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/45-allow-colord.pkla

sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/45-allow-colord.pkla

Paste in the following:


[Allow Colord all Users]
Identity=unix-user:*
Action=org.freedesktop.color-manager.create-device;org.freedesktop.color-manager.create-profile;org.freedesktop.color-manager.delete-device;org.freedesktop.color-manager.delete-profile;org.freedesktop.color-manager.modify-device;org.freedesktop.color-manager.modify-profile
ResultAny=no
ResultInactive=no
ResultActive=yes



Save and exit (press CTRL + X, press Y and then press ENTER)

This tells Polkit to continue without requiring the authentication prompt over RDP.

Now reboot Ubuntu and try logging in again over RDP / Windows Remote Desktop and the popups should be gone.
