in Dolphin
open 'Network'

then click on 'Add Network Folder'
then select Microsoft Windows network drive

click on Next

in 'Name' just type a label for your network folder
in 'Server' type the IP or hostname of your server in this way:

myserver.local

in 'Folder' type the location desired

for example

\home

if you know that the path

myserver.local\home

exists


DONE!

REMEMBER! Just use the correct slash as in Windows this is:
'\'
and not the '/'!

if everything has worked correctly then it should ask to authenticate
