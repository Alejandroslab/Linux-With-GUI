AUTOMOUNTING

To make the mounting persistent (means that will be automatically mounted after a reboot)

you have to edit the 'fstab' file that contains a list of entries
that define where how and what filesystem will be mounted on system startup

therefore open it :

sudo nano /etc/fstab

and add these:

# <file system>                               <dir>               <type> <options>                                                                                              <dump>  <pass>
//NETWORK_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP/<share_name> /home/me/myfoldername cifs  credentials=/etc/myservercredentials,uid=1000,gid=1000,dir_mode=0777,file_mode=0777,x-systemd.automount 0       0

REMEMBER! after the commas you must not place any space
REMEMBER! in this case we are specifing the user '1000' that is the first non-root user.
Therefore permission could be set up as '777' (or better '775')
CAREFUL! In Debian 10 you MUST add the option 'x-systemd.automount' otherwise it will not work in any way
(this has been reported in the official documentation)

save and exit than run :

sudo mount /home/me/myfoldername

The mount command, will read the content of the /etc/fstab and mount the share.

Next time you reboot the system, the Windows share will be mounted automatically
