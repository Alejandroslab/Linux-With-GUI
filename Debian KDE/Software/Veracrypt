just download the .deb package for Debian (with GUI) and

run it as usual:

sudo dpkg -i veracrypt.... .deb

done!

you will find it in the menu!

REMEMBER! If you have an hd or small usb that
has 2 volumes inside just select the one that has the biggest size!

this means when you click on 'Select Device'

you will see:

/dev/sdb

  /dev/sdb1  100 mb
  /dev/sdb2  29.6 gb

In this case you have to select /dev/sdb2 and not the whole device '/dev/sdb'

you will then find the mounted volume in Dolphin
