just:

chmod a+x myapp.AppImage

then run:

./myapp.AppImage



it is known that tutanota provides appimage format for linux

if there is some error regarding the sandbox like
'The SUID sandbox helper binary was found but is not configure correctly.
Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now..'

to solve that you can run the app (after launching the previous commands) with the '--no-sandbox' argument
in this way:

./myapp.AppImage --no-sandbox
