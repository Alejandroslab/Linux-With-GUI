Simply disconnect from other devices the keyboard
then pair it on Debian
It will show a PIN. Just click OK on it.

everything should work well!
(you may need to previous install the libinput stuff for magic trackpad. not sure about this)

if you have the magic keyboard with numeric pad you can enable it pressing
the key above the '7' in the numeric pad (that in Mac will be a key to delete).
This in Debian will wor as a swtich to enable the numeric pad.

If you don't enable it, it will not work and will only work the keys
