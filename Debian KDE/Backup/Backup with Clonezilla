Using windows, download an ISO image of Clonezilla
then using rufus create the live usb on a usb stick

now run on your linux machine

you can choose "disk to disk" (follow the official instructions)
but REMEMBER! if your target disk (e.g. the external HD) is larger than your source disk (the one that
you will backup)
 you will not be able to use all your space
as Clonezilla will create a full copy of your HD and create a partition table
as MBR that means that
only 2TB will be supporte (any additional space
will remain unused and you will not be able to use in any way
(in Windows in the Disk utility
it will remain as unallocated space without possibilty to use it))


Anyways you will find all the disks as they will be mounted and you will
be able to browse folders (but be sure that disk will be almost of the same size because
of the problem describe above) (the format shown will be 'basic partition' in WIndows it will ask
to format)



Seeing the problem of larger disk, and knowing
that perhaps you just want to use ALL your disk capacity
you may want to just create a backup image:
you have to have a NTFS formatted external HD
then choose "disk to image"
select the destination disk then the source one (in this order. anyways follow the instructions)

This procedure will save a compressed image in multiple parts.
If you want to access your files you will have to restore the image using again clonezilla
no way to restore uncompressing with any other tool.

In order to have a backup in one partition just create first a partition (even with Disk maangement in Windows),
shrinking a larger partiton.
Just create a partition of the size of your source hard disk.

Then just use the 'device to device' option and select the correct partitions!
when the process is finished you have been cloned your disk
