Just go to
Tools->Customize->keyboard

in the first table scroll the list and look for these shortcuts:

ctrl++

ctrl+-

assign ctrl++ to 150%
and ctrl+- to 75%

you have then a partial way to set up a zoom
as the zoom will not increase or decrease with the pinch

anyways this will work with the trackpad as in libinput config file

we have set up

gesture pinch in 2 xdotool keys ctrl +

and

gesture pinch out 2 xdottol keys ctrl -

see the 'Apple Magic Trackpad' file in this repo
