This has been tested with Apple Magic Keyboard 2

you can find the setting here:

cd /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters

then sudo nano fnmode

you will find the number '1'
this means that is enabled the function keys (multimedia will have preference) by default

if you want to disable you have just to replace with '2'
and your fn key will work as in the old systems

to be faster you can just run:

echo 2 | sudo tee /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode

if you want to switch it again just change the number:

echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode

this command will basically replace the number in the file
