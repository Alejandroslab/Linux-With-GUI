In any app when you choose to open a file in the
column on the left it will not be displayed any
Newtork folder

to enable it you just have to go to

cd /etc/samba

Then

sudo nano smb.conf

Insert in the [global] section (the very first section just read
the file carefully) this line:

client max protocol = NT1

save and exit then restart smbd and nmbd

sudo service smbd restart
sudo service nmbd restart
