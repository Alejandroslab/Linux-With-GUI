first: disconnect the magic trackpad from other devices(e.g. if you have previously linked
to a Mac)

then turn off it

now:

You need to install the libinput gestures

first add your user to input group:

sudo gpasswd -a $USER input

where $USER will automatically recall your username
now

reboot your machine!
it is mandatory otherwise it will not work

after restarting


install the necessary dependecies


sudo apt-get install xdotool wmctrl git python3 libinput-tools build-essential

mkdir ~/src/

cd ~/src/

git clone https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures.git
cd libinput-gestures

sudo make install

libinput-gestures-setup autostart

the autostart will allow to automatically start the service at login

libinput-gestures-setup start

Read /etc/libinput-gestures.conf to see other options

done!

now it will work

(maybe these steps are also necessary if you want to work with apple magic keyboard)

just turn on your apple trackpad
click on bluetooth and pair the device (no need to specify any PIN)

and you are done!


__________________________

ENABLE SCROLLING

to enable scrolling you will need a driver called 'Linux Apple Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2 Driver'

you can find it in github:
firs install dkms
sudo apt-get install dkms
git clone https://github.com/rohitpid/Linux-Magic-Trackpad-2-Driver.git
cd Linux-Magic-Trackpad-2-Driver/scripts
chmod u+x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh

now if you want to change something first install 'xinput' package

sudo apt-get install xinput

now run it:

xinput or xinput --list

you will see all the devices with their names. In this case the relevant one in called
'Apple Inc. Magic Trackpad 2'

to see all the properites just type:

xinput --list-props 'Apple Inc. Magic Trackpad 2'

if you see 'libinput' at the very beginning of each line means that libinput is in charge of the
trackpad

now in case for example you want to enable the Natural Scrolling (that will invert
the scrolling direction), you have just to type:

xinput --set-prop 'Apple Inc. Magic Trackpad 2' "libinput Natural Scrolling Enabled" 1

you have to enable this in case you want the same experience of the Mac

you have also to enable tapping:

xinput --set-prop 'Apple Inc. Magic Trackpad 2' "Tapping Enabled" 1

done!

The problem with these commands is that they will not survive a reboot


TO MAKE IT PERMANENT:
you need to open the so called 'xorg configuration files' and edit the option
in that file.
To do that just go here:
cd /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d

and open the '40-libinput.conf' file:

sudo nano 40-libinput.conf


inside this file look for:

Section "InputClass"
Identifier "libinput touchpad catchall"
...

and at the end of the section (but before the 'EndSection') add your options:

In this case the section will be like th

Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "libinput touchpad catchall"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
        Driver "libinput"
        Option "TappingButtonMap" "lrm"
        Option "Tapping" "on"
        Option "NaturalScrolling" "true"

EndSection

where the Option Tapping on will enable tapping, the NaturalScrolling true will enable natural scrolling

and the TappingButtonMap will change the order of Tapping
with lrm (left, right, middle)
you will have:
tap with 1 finger: left Click
tap with 2 fingers: right click
tap with 3 fingers: middle click

you can also invert 'lrm' to 'lmr' (even this is not the usual behaviour in Mac)

REMEMBER! After editing this file REBOOT your system to make the changes PERMANENT


________

ENABLE PINCH TO ZOOM AND OTHER GESTURES
as we have already install libinput-gestures we can now add gestures

first be sure to stop the program with:

libinput-gestures-setup stop

you can check the status with:

libinput-gestures-setup status

then set the app as a systemd user service as this will work better as stated
in the githun project. 'The systemd user
service option for libinput-gestures was added in Feb 2021
and provides more robust management and better logging than
the desktop so is now the preferred choice. '

libinput-gestures-setup service

if you have setup it firstly as a desktop service a message will appear notifying that
the desktop config file has been deleted




now, after stopping open the config file:

cd /etc

sudo nano libinput-gestures.conf

go to the end of the file and add these 2 lines :

# zoom
gesture pinch   in    2  xdotool key ctrl+minus
gesture pinch   out   2  xdotool key ctrl+plus

you can also add more stuff following the syntax as before
remembering that the numnber correspond to the number of fingers for the gestures


after that just enable the appt to automatically run in the background when you Login
libinput-gestures-setup autostart

and start the app immediately:

libinput-gestures-setup start

now your gestures work!

to upgrade your libinput gesture:

# cd to source dir, as above
git pull
sudo make install (or sudo ./libinput-gestures-setup install)
libinput-gestures-setup restart


if you suspend the system and then boot up again
linpiut gesture could not load correctly and the gestures will not work therefore:

libinput-gestures-setup restart

you can add it to your xsession file in order to automatically run the program


OTHER GESTURES
you can add more gestures in the

sudo nano /etc/libinput-gestures.conf

like these  ones

#swipe up to show all windows opened
gesture swipe up 4 xdotool key ctrl+F10
gesture swipe down 4 xdotool key ctrl+F10

ctrl+f10 will open the windows selector (will display all opened windows)

#show desktop
gesture pinch out 4 xdotool key ctrl+F12

ctrl+f12 will temporary show desktop (as in Mac) putting aside all Windows

cool!

the problem is that if you suspend the system your gesture will not load and you will have to
load it manually just running:

libinput-gestures-setup restart

find where to put this command in order to run it after suspension
