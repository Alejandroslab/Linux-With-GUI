first: disconnect the magic trackpad from other devices(e.g. if you have previously linked
to a Mac)

then turn off it

now:

You need to install the libinput gestures

first add your user to input group:

sudo gpasswd -a $USER input

where $USER will automatically recall your username
now

reboot your machine!
it is mandatory otherwise it will not work

after restarting


install the necessary dependecies


sudo apt-get install xdotool wmctrl git python3 libinput-tools build-essential

mkdir ~/src/

cd ~/src/

git clone https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures.git
cd libinput-gestures

sudo make install

libinput-gestures-setup autostart

the autostart will allow to automatically start the service at login 

libinput-gestures-setup start

Read /etc/libinput-gestures.conf to see other options

done!

now it will work

(maybe these steps are also necessary if you want to work with apple magic keyboard)

just turn on your apple trackpad
click on bluetooth and pair the device (no need to specify any PIN)

and you are done!
