Update things first...

sudo apt-get update

Now install xrdp:

sudo apt install xrdp 

Check status

sudo systemctl status xrdp

Add user xrdp to ssl-cert

sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert  

(evenutally configure your firewall (ufw or whatever))
To check hostname and/or ip:

hostname

hostname -I


Now remote desktop on Windows. Type the hostname or IP 

Access with credetianls. But remember:

ONLY SUDO USER OR ROOT CAN CONNECT WITH RDP (REMOTE DESKOTP FOR WINDOWS)

if you try to connect with credentials of a normal user it will not work. The connection will abort.

It will also be not possible to use RDP while the same user is already logged. (you have to logout)

Debian seem to be more strict on authorisations.
