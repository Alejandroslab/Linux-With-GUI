sudo zypper install xrdp

sudo systemctl enable xrdp

sudo systemctl start xrdp

sudo systemctl stop firewalld

Since openSuse 15 the new firewall is firewalld and not SUSEfirewall2

you must run these commands to add an exception in firewalld:

sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=3389/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Then open the YaST Control Center

Click on Network Services then 'Remote Administration (VNC)'
Click on 'Allow Remote Administration Without Session Management'

Also check the 'Enable access using a web browser'

Click on next you will see that also Xorg will be installed

REMEMBER! Without downloading xorg rdp will not work as rdp cannot work only with VNC on opensuse


Finally you can change the windows manager

to do that just got /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh

and change the line:

SESSION="gnome"

to SESSION="plasma"

and done

If you have followed this instruction you will not need to disable firewalld.service

You can enable it and xrdp will work Anyways

REMEMBER! Multiuser is not working at the moment. Therefore you cannot login with the same user from local and also from remote
