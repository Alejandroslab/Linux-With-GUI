When booting up from the Live USB or (.iso in case of a VM)
it could happen that it will hang on a black screen

to solve it just press (or pass in case of a vm)

Ctrl + alt + F2

this will open a terminal

now it will ask for a user and password:

the user is: neon
the password:
(is blank. this means that you have to leave it pressing enter without inserting any password)


now it will open the terminal session

now to launch the GUI just type:

startx

DONE! it will launch the live usb of KDE Neon.
Then you can choose to install it.
