always need to first study how your system is partitioned 

disks have names like 
sda, sdb, sdc...

partitions are inside disks e have a number so there are:

sda1, sda2 etc

If you change the partitions it may happen that your os will become unbootable it will appear the 'grub rescue' command line

to restore the GRUB you can use the usb and boot a live os 

from there access to terminal and chroot

chroot stands for 'change root'. it allows to enter in a installed linux os root folder and from there make changes 

in manjaro e garuda chroot is easy 
in garuda there is also an easy button 

anyways is something like 'manjaro-chroot'

now you need to install grub with the command grub-install


in this way:

grub-install /dev/sda

if appears an error saying 

that 

error: cannot find EFI directory 

this means that you need to investigate further the partition table 



you can do that with 

fdisk -l


or just doing for the disk in whcih linux is installed:

fdisk -l /dev/sda

and check where is the EFI partition 

let's suppose the EFI partition is placed in sda1 

then we need to mount it in /boot/efi

if for some reson the directory /boot/efi does not exist then just create it

mkdir /boot/efi

finally mount the EFI (in the sda1 in our exaple) inside the new directory just created


mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi

done!

finally 

grub-install /dev/sda/

when it states 'operation completed' just reboot and everything is back in place !
