Update first (as sometimes installation without previous update does not work)

sudo apt-get update

then install xrdp

sudo apt-get install xrdp 

after installation is completed everything is done!

Go to Windows, open Remote Desktop Connection, put the IP or hostname of the machine

(remember "hostname -I" or "hostname" commands)

in the appearing window leave 'Xorg' 
and put your user and password.

Done!

(It will work on Debian, Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, etc)
