Update first (as sometimes installation without previous update does not work)

sudo apt-get update

then install xrdp

sudo apt-get install xrdp

after installation is completed everything is done!
(sometimes xrdp will not start automatically (as in Debian KDE) therefore
you may want to check status of the service with:

systemctl status xrdp

if it is not active, activate with

sudo systemctl start xrdp

then check again if the service is activate

systemctl status xrdp
)



Go to Windows, open Remote Desktop Connection, put the IP or hostname of the machine

(remember "hostname -I" or "hostname" commands)

in the appearing window leave 'Xorg'
and put your user and password.

Done!

Remember to make it work that you have to logout with the desired user in the remote machine
otherwise remote desktop will allow you to login but will shutdown immediately!

If the GUI starts only with the command 'startx' you have to logout as in the normal case
you will get back to the terminal side and then can launch remote desktop.


(It will work on Debian, Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, etc)
