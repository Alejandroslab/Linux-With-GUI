When booting up from the Live USB or (.iso in case of a VM)
it could happen that it will hang on a black screen

To see what is happening while loading and in a polite text version just type
Shift+Esc

the loading bar will be replaced by lines of terminal that
notifies about what is happening (loading grub, modules, network etc..)


Anyways, to solve it just press (or pass the command in case of a vm)

Ctrl + alt + F2

this will open a terminal

now it will ask to login with credentials:

In Kde Neon the user is: neon
the password:
(is blank. this means that you have to leave it pressing 'enter' without inserting any password)


now it will open the terminal session

now to launch the GUI just type:

startx

DONE! This will launch the live usb of KDE Neon.
Then you can choose to install it as usual.
