Just add a "sudo" before evert command

apt-get update

Get an updated list of installable packages
apt-get install xrdp

Install the RDP server

systemctl start xrdp

Start the base XRDP server

systemctl start xrdp-sesman
Start the XRDP session manager


If you encounter a blank screen the reboot the machine but to not log in.
Only log in with remote desktop. This is due to multiple sessions. One remote and one local.

To solve this “second session” problem and allow as many sessions as you need,

edit /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh and add these lines BEFORE the lines that test and execute Xsession.

The $HOME/.profile is not part of the solution (IS NOT NECESSARY), but is something that should be run before starting the session anyway.

    unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
    unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
    . $HOME/.profile
