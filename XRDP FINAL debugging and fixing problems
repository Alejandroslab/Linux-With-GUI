You can watch live debugging with

sudo systemctl status xrdp

or just print this:

 sudo cat /var/log/xrdp.log


you can also look here for session manager (sesman):

/var/log/xrdp-sesman.log


Anyways even if you have the logs sometimes you cannot know what is the problem as the log is not too much verbose about it


Therefore you may want to guess..

I HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH DEBIAN 10. 
Here I describe the steps that I followed in order to get to a solution..


First check that you do not have any firewall in place, liike ufw, firewalld, iptables and other..
You can check it listing the active services with:

systemctl

You may see the 'networking' service as 'failed'

to fix this:

sudo mv /etc/network/interfaces.d/setup ~

just move the files to the home folder.
Then reboot the machine

AFTER THIS PASSAGE XRDP MAY GO BACK AT WORK. But I am not quite sure about it. If it still does not work proceed with the other steps:




If you do not any firewall and no errors in services, it is better that you proceed to uninstall xrdp and all the dipendencies and then get a fresh install of it

sudo apt-get purge xrdp

and reinstall it 

sudo apt-get install xrdp 

(in debian you may want to add the xrdp user to ssl group)


Reboot. if the error persist then check all these steps:





FILES TO INSPECT FOR ERRORS:

The files in which to look are different 


1) the first one:

/etc/xrdp/xrpd.ini


Here everyhting must be left as default 
(in particular in 'session types' where xorg must be left with port=-1 as well as vnc, vnc any and neutrino that must not be commented and left as default)


2) The same applies for 

/etc/xrdp/sesman.ini


here everything must not be touched. Port 3350 is correct. Do not touch it


3) Then in /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config 
leave as default, with the line:

allowed_users=console

DO NOT CHANGE as suggested on the internet (the workaround to change it in 'anybody' may be working for older versions of xrdp or xorgxrdp but as of the version
xrdp 0.9.9-1 is not working )
(remember to check the package version run the command:   apt list xrdp)



4) in /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh

after the long if statement regarding the default locale settings place this:

----

if test -r /etc/profile; then
        . /etc/profile
fi


unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
test -x /etc/X11/Xsession && exec /etc/X11/Xsession
exec /bin/sh /etc/X11/Xsession

----

the first part is an if statement that recalls the profile file
you will see the same statement at the very beginning of the same 'startwm.sh' file but that is perfectly ok. 
it is not redundant even if it seems so, therefore do not delete it!

Finally, as commented in other files, before the 2 final lines 'test' and then 'exec' place the 2 'unset' lines as indicated.

save and exit




5) then in /etc/sddm.conf 
(only for KDE as for other desktops you may want to inspect gdm, etc..)

leave 

[Autologin]
Relogin=true

and do not change to 'false' as the relogin seems do not cause any problem for this xrdp package..



6) FINALLY if in your home there are some hidden files called .xsession and something related like 

.xession, .xsession-errors, .xession-save 

(inside these files you will see a line invoking plasma-session and other regarding logs of this invoke stuff)

DELETE THEM!! and reboot the machine !

after deleting them (and IF ALL OTHER FILES HAVE BEEN EVENTUALLY CORRECTED AS STATED) xrdp must go back working again!  


I suspect that these files were the culprit of xrdp not working... not quite sure though. 
Took me 4 hours...
