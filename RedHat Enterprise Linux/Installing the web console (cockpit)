sudo yum install cockpit
systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket

Now add the cockpit as an exception in the firewall rule:
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent

then reload:
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

done!

Open the web console in your web browser:

   Locally: https://localhost:9090
   Remotely with the server’s hostname: https://example.com:9090

   Remotely with the server’s IP address: https://192.0.2.2:9090

   If you use a self-signed certificate, the browser issues a warning. Check the certificate and accept the security exception to proceed with the login.

   The console loads a certificate from the /etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d directory and uses the last file with a .cert extension in alphabetical order. To avoid having to grant security exceptions, install a certificate signed by a certificate authority (CA).

   In the login screen, enter your system user name and password.
   (The system ones not the registration ones)
