For the installation I have burnt the qubes os 4.2.3 with rufus on a usb stick

then I run the installation selecting "Troubleshooting installation" but instead of press enter
I pressed the letter 'e' and added

/mapbs
/noexitboot 

at the end of the parameters
then I pressed ctrl+x in order to start the installation.

Finally when you finish install do not reboot go to another tty.
ctrl + alt + F2 to go to tty2 
go to:


/mnt/sysimage/boot/efi/EFI/qubes/xen.cfg 

(you can use vi or nano editor) and add:

 mapbs=1
 noexitboot=1

Note: You must add these parameters on two separate new lines 

MY NOTE: The file xen.cfg did not exist. Anyways I have created it with the two parameters set to 1
I have noticed that there were other file some grub.efi but also a grub.cfg
I have  added to the grub.cfg the 2 parameters at the end of the file. 

SO I HAVE ADDED THE TWO PARAMETERS TO THE PREEXISTIN FILE grub.cfg but also to the non existing
file xen.cfg


Go back to tty6 (Ctrl-Alt-F6) and click Reboot.

Now if you have set up your bios with legacy + uefi you may not enter in the Qubes installation drive
Qubes have been installed as UEFI therefore you must select the OS in the boot menu when you start the pc

(You can now go to your bios menu and disable legacy mode and just leave the UEFI one in order to auotmaically boot Qubes)


Continue with setting up default templates and logging in to Qubes.
