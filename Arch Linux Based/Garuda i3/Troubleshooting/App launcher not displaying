Just follow the instructions

Remember that the configuration files for the app launcher (the one that you can start with Super + d)
are in:

/home/myusername/.config/rofi

open the file config.rasi and you will find all the appearance settings

The error that I have encountered is a syntax error in the code that appears to be deprecated

Just delete the line (dd in Vim) and add at the end of the file the line

@theme "gorgeHousse"

done
