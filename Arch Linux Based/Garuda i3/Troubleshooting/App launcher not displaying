Just follow the instructions

Remember that the configuration files for the app launcher (the one that you can start with Super + d)
are in:

/home/myusername/.config/rofi

open the file config.rasi and you will find all the appearance settings

The error that I have encountered is a syntax error in the code regarding the theme import that appears to be deprecated

Just delete the line (dd in Vim) and add at the end of the file the line

@theme "gorgeHousse"

this will import the theme gorgeHousse.rasi that you will find in the same folder 

done
