First check that your hardware is recognized properly (otherwise further research is needed)

lsubs

then in Manjaro KDE Plasma, as told by documentation:

"The package xf86-input-wacom will be automatically installed when installing the kcm-wacomtablet from community repository."


Therefore just install this:

sudo pacman -S kcm-wacomtablet 

All the necessary dependencies will be installed

done. reboot your system!


This will add Tablet Settings interface/configuration in the System Settings + the needed background services for KDE Plasma Framework. 


Last step!
go to the settings under System Settings>Hardware>Input Devices>Graphic Tablet 

and uncheck under 'Touch' tab the option 'Enable Gestures'

This because you will not be able to use touchscreen with your fngers as well as the stylus by default. 
(This is true if you have a device that has touchscreen as well as an incorporated stylus)



Anyways these configurations are stored in : ~/.config/tabletprofilesrc
You can change it from there too
