You may want to install in dual boot arch with Windows

You may want also to change the boot order and set Windows as default.

You can inspect /etc/grub/grub.cfg

in any 'menu entry' part you will see the different OS's (if you have more than 2) 

if windows appears as second entry the you will known that its position will be the '2'

Thereofre open:

vim /etc/default/grub

in GRUB_DEFAULT set '2'

GRUB_DEFAULT=2

save and exit then run:

sudo update-grub

finally test it rebooting your pc


If the posiiton is not '2' then inspect further the file grub.cfg
