The error:

error: jansson: signature from "Eli Schwartz <eschwartz@archlinux.org>" is invalid

Just try to update your system with 

sudo pacman -Syu

THen it should go work

or just reset the keyring:

If you're getting an error similar to "Canâ€™t update: signature from *** is marginal trust" or "invalid or corrupted package" you probably just need to update your package signing keys: 

sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring chaotic-keyring 

sudo pacman -Syu

you will be asked to use the command 'garuda-update' instead of 'sudo pacman -Syu'

press y
