If you have a device that supports touchscreen (convertible notebooks) 
you will notice that there is no on screen keyboard that will automatically appear when editing text (this is available only for Gnome. No KDE Plasma)

Therefore just download onboard

sudo pacman -S onboard



Tip: set 'Terminus' as font. That will give a robotic, modern and fresh look and feel to the virtual keyboard
