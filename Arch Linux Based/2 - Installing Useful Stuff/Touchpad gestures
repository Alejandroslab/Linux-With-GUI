Just install  libinput-gestures

you will also need xdotool


Then you can have a GUI in order to set up your gestures installing 'gestures' (or you can set the gestures with the config file)

You can then open the app called 'Gestures' and set your gestures 

To Show all windows with a gesture with a swipe up with 4 fingers (like in MacOS) and to set more gestures
have a look in the Shortcuts section in System Settings (in particular under System Services>KWin)

then with 'xdotool' you will be able to recall that shortcut assignin it to a gesture, indicating it as a command

Therefore for the 'Show all windows' with a swipe up with 4 fingers :

select swipe up, 4 fingers then in the command space enter this:

xdotool key Ctrl+F10

as Ctrl+F10 is the shortcut assigne to Show all Windows in KWin section in Settings

Done!

Now just wait while the profile reloads (you will see a litlle hand that will bounce for some seconds)
And then done!





you can also set different other gestures !

the command for change desktop is:
 
_internal_ws_up

you can assign it to another swipe up or down gesture

Or you can choose pinch 2 fingers Out and set

xdotool key Ctrl + plus

in order to have zoom in, and:

xdotool key Ctrl + minus

to have zoom out
