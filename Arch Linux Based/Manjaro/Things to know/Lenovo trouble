Seems that there is a problem with the installation of Manjaro on a Lenovo laptop

No grub appears

you can list your grubs with the command:

efibootmgr

when booted in live cd 

there is no manjaro

I have partially solved this installing on another partition another linux os like garuda 

This install its GRUB correctly and will also appear in the list of 'efibootmgr'

From there you can acces Manajaro choosing 'Advanced options' and then the option with 'fallback inittramfs'
