After the installation it can happen that Windows will not allow you to load the Manajaro.efi

Anyways to load up your system 


    boot up livecd in the right mode, uefi or bios-legacy
    Do not boot up to live OS, but press ‘c’ at the start menu and we’ll get to the grub prompt (grub>).
    To be sure you've started up livecd in the right mode, at grub prompt, check output of
     

grub> echo $grub_platform

If output is pc , you've booted up in bios-legacy.
If output is efi , you've booted up in uefi.
If you're in the wrong mode, reboot livecd in the right mode.

    If you are in the right mode, continue.

grub> search.file /etc/manjaro-release  root
grub> configfile /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Now your Manajro installed versions should run!

otherwise:

grub> boot

and it should run
