In Manjaro if you enter wrongly your password for some times then your account is locked in

This is valid for any tty. Even if you change you will see that your account is temporarily locked

as this may be really annoying here is how to disable this feature:


open :

/etc/security/faillock.conf

then set

deny=0

(uncomment it if it is commented)
