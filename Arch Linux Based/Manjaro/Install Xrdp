successfully installed on Manjaro XFCE 4

First install the last xrdp and the xorgxrdp-git (driver for xrdp)
You will find them in the AUR repository that you can access it with 'yay'


Therefore first install yay:

sudo pacman -S yay

Then install it:

sudo yay -S aur/xrdp aur/xorgxrdp-git

If they cannot be installed because 'a shared library is missing ' or something similar
You need to update your system with:

sudo pacman -Syyu

Now during the update you can incurr in some conflict with some packages

If they do not let you do the update just try to remove them being careful as if they weight more than some megabytes
you have to find for what they are needed in order to avoid system instability

to remo the packages:

sudo pacman -R nameofpackage

After removing them rerun the system update

sudo pacman -Syyu

Finally install xrdp and the xorgxrdp-git

Within the terminal you can incurr in some other errors therefore I installed them from GUI

Go to start and open 'Add/Remove Software'

Be sure that on Preferences 'AUR' is enabled
Then look for xrdp and the xorgxrdp-git and build them

Now go to /etc/X11
and create this file (as it will not probably exist)

sudo nano /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config

Inside type:

allowed_users = anybody

now edit this file:

sudo nano .xinitrc

and edit:
Change SESSION=${1:-xfce-session} to read SESSION=${1:-xfce4-session}
Change local dbus_args=(–sh-syntax –exit-with-session) to read local dbus_args=(–sh-syntax)
Change exec $(get_session “$1”) to read exec $(get_session “$SESSION”)




then run

sudo systemctl enable xrdp
sudo systemctl enable xrdp-sesman

sudo systemctl start xrdp

DONE!
Reboot your system and it should work
