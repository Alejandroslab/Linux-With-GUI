successfully installed on Manjaro XFCE 4 and KDE Plasma 5.24


First install the last xrdp and the xorgxrdp-git (driver for xrdp)
You will find them in the AUR repository that you can access it with 'yay'


IT IS SAFER TO INSTALL VIA GUI. GO SOME LINES BELOW HERE:

Therefore first install yay:

sudo pacman -S yay

Then install it:

yay -S aur/xrdp aur/xorgxrdp-git

(avoid using sudo with yay)

If they cannot be installed because 'a shared library is missing ' or something similar
You need to update your system with:

sudo pacman -Syyu

Now during the update you can incurr in some conflict with some packages

If they do not let you do the update just try to remove them being careful as if they weight more than some megabytes
you have to find for what they are needed in order to avoid system instability

to remove the packages:

sudo pacman -R nameofpackage

After removing them rerun the system update

sudo pacman -Syyu

Finally install xrdp and the xorgxrdp-git

_________________________
INSTALLING WITH GUI

With the terminal you can incurr in some other errors therefore I installed them from GUI

Go to start and open 'Add/Remove Software'

Be sure that on Preferences 'AUR' is enabled
Then look for xrdp and the xorgxrdp-git and build them!

_____________________________________________

Now for KDE you can run (REMEMBER! FOR XFCE I HAVE RUN THESE COMMANDS AT THE END WHILE FOR KDE I HAVE RUN AS IN THE ORDER POSTED HERE):
(skip this passage for XFCE)

sudo systemctl enable xrdp.service
sudo systemctl enable xrdp-sesman.service

you can now try :

sudo systemctl start xrdp

if it does not work just follow the next instructions 
________________________________________________

Now run this:

sudo echo “allowed_users=anybody” >> /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config
(basically this will append the text between double quotes inside the file in the path indicated)

If this last commands will return error it's because the file probably still does not exist

Therefore go to /etc/X11
and create this file (as it will not probably exist)

sudo vim /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config

Inside type:

allowed_users = anybody


Ok done. last step:

edit this file:

sudo vim .xinitrc

and edit:
______________________
for XFCE:

SESSION=${1:-xfce-session}
to read SESSION=${1:-xfce4-session}
Change

local dbus_args=(–sh-syntax –exit-with-session)

to read local dbus_args=(–sh-syntax)
Change

exec $(get_session “$1”)
to read exec $(get_session “$SESSION”)


__________
for KDE:
comment this line (should be the last line of the file)

exec $(get_session “$1”)

and add at the end of the file:

exec dbus-launch --sh-syntax startplasma-x11

done!


reboot your system and for kde you have done!

_________________________


Conversely for XFCE now run these:

sudo systemctl enable xrdp
sudo systemctl enable xrdp-sesman

sudo systemctl start xrdp

DONE!
Reboot your system and it should work
