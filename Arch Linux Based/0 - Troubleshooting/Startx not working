if the server (that is xorg or wayland) terminate the process with an error you need to check the error

If you see that some library is missing something like:

'version GLIBC_2.34' not found and then all other errors that depend on a specific package/library then try to run a full system upgrade:

sudo pacman -Syu

the last 'u' stands for upgrade

type yes and wait

after rebooting desktop server may run

if it does not you need more troubleshooting investingating the error
You need the logs for xorg or wayland and maybe the logs for the kernel

usually it is just a matter of uprgrading your system as some dependencies may not been upgraded yet..

good luck
